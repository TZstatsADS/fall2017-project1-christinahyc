### Doc folder

**homework1ADS.Rmd** is for the project, you can see the output [here](https://github.com/TZstatsADS/fall2017-project1-christinahyc/tree/master/output)

**ADShw1_forFUN.R** is JUST for fun! It will take TONS of time to run it, but the result is really interesting. The output will be generated in ~/output as "FunOut.txt"

Make sure your computer has python installed. It also needs some python packages, make sure you have them all. (I tried my best to write down scripts for installation, but since I already get parts of them installed, I may missed some packages... ) Feel free to contact me if you have any questions (**yuchen.huang@columbia.edu**)

Thanks!
