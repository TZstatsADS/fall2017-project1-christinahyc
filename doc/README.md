### Doc folder

homework1ADS.Rmd is for the project

ADShw1_forFUN.R is JUST for fun! It will take TONS of time to run it, but the result is really interesting. Make sure your computer has python installed. It also need some more python packages, make sure you have them all. (I already have most of them so didn't record what is required...) Feel free to contact me if you have any questions (yuchen.huang@columbia.edu)

Thanks!
